## Overview of Repository

### Folders

There are two folders:

  * The rodeo folder-this folder contains the cleaned data and the files to render the analyses.
  
  * The wrangling folder-this contains the raw data and the scripts to prepare the data for analysis (that is, the rodeo folder).

Each folder contains a README file that describes the contents of the folder in more detail.
